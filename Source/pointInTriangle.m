function   [TorF] = pointInTriangle(P, A, B, C)
%   POINTINTRIANGLE Calculate the differences between the points
%   Input:  P,A,B,C ï¿½ a 1X2 matrix (x,y) containing a point in 2D
%           tri pointsList - n-by-2 matrix that stores control points
%           mesh ï¿½ an m-by-3 matrix that stores the triangles of the mesh.
%           Each row of the mesh contains the 3 row numbers of a pointList that make up a
%           single triangle.
%
%   Output: TorF -True or false. Returns True if point P is in triangle defined by A,B,C

P12 = A - B;
P23 = B - C;
P31 = C - A;

% Returns True if point P is in triangle defined by A,B,C
